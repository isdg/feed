## Classical Derivative

The classical derivative of a function \\(f: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}\\) at a point \\(x\\) is defined by the limit \\( f'(x) = \\frac{df}{dx} = \\lim\_{h \\to 0} \\frac{f(x+h) - f(x)}{h} \\). This value represents the instantaneous rate of change of the function \\(f\\) with respect to its variable \\(x\\), and geometrically corresponds to the slope of the tangent line to the graph of \\(f\\) at \\((x, f(x))\\). Its derivation stems from considering the average rate of change over a shrinking interval \\(\[x, x+h\]\\), represented by the slope of the secant line \\( \\frac{f(x+h) - f(x)}{h} \\), and taking the limit as the interval width \\(h\\) approaches zero.

## One-Sided Derivative

One-sided derivatives consider the rate of change as \\(x\\) is approached from only one direction. The right derivative is \\( f'\_+(x) = \\lim\_{h \\to 0^+} \\frac{f(x+h) - f(x)}{h} \\) (where \\(h\\) approaches 0 from positive values), and the left derivative is \\( f'\_-(x) = \\lim\_{h \\to 0^-} \\frac{f(x+h) - f(x)}{h} \\) (where \\(h\\) approaches 0 from negative values). These are derived using the same limit definition as the classical derivative, but restricting \\(h\\) to be either strictly positive or strictly negative. The classical derivative exists if and only if both the left and right derivatives exist and are equal.

## Higher Order Derivative

Higher order derivatives are obtained by repeatedly applying the differentiation process. The \\(n\\)-th derivative, denoted \\(f^{(n)}(x)\\) or \\(\\frac{d^n f}{dx^n}\\), is defined recursively as the derivative of the \\((n-1)\\)-th derivative: \\( f^{(n)}(x) = \\frac{d}{dx} \\left( f^{(n-1)}(x) \\right) \\). For instance, the second derivative \\( f''(x) = \\frac{d^2 f}{dx^2} = \\lim\_{h \\to 0} \\frac{f'(x+h) - f'(x)}{h} \\) measures the rate of change of the first derivative (like acceleration) and relates to the function's concavity. Each higher order derivative measures the rate of change of the preceding one.

## Implicit Derivative

Implicit differentiation is a technique, rather than a specific formula, used when a relationship between \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) is given implicitly by an equation \\(F(x, y) = 0\\), defining \\(y\\) as a function of \\(x\\) locally. To find \\(\\frac{dy}{dx}\\), one differentiates both sides of the equation \\(F(x, y(x)) = 0\\) with respect to \\(x\\), treating \\(y\\) as \\(y(x)\\) and applying the chain rule where necessary (e.g., \\(\\frac{d}{dx}(y^2) = 2y \\frac{dy}{dx}\\)). The resulting equation is then algebraically solved for \\(\\frac{dy}{dx}\\). This allows finding the derivative without explicitly solving for \\(y\\).

## Complex Derivative

The derivative of a complex function \\(f: \\mathbb{C} \\to \\mathbb{C}\\) at \\(z\_0 \\in \\mathbb{C}\\) is defined similarly to the real case: \\( f'(z\_0) = \\lim\_{h \\to 0} \\frac{f(z\_0+h) - f(z\_0)}{h} \\). However, here \\(h \\in \\mathbb{C}\\), and the limit must exist and yield the same value regardless of the path along which \\(h\\) approaches 0 in the complex plane. This path-independence requirement is very strong, distinguishing complex differentiability (holomorphicity) from real differentiability in \\(\\mathbb{R}^2\\) and implying the function satisfies the Cauchy-Riemann equations. It represents the complex rate of change.

## Partial Derivative

For a multivariable function \\(f(x\_1, x\_2, ..., x\_n)\\), the partial derivative with respect to one variable \\(x\_i\\) at a point \\(\\mathbf{a}\\), denoted \\(\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x\_i}(\\mathbf{a})\\), measures the function's rate of change along the \\(x\_i\\) coordinate direction while holding all other variables constant. Its formula is \\( \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x\_i}(\\mathbf{a}) = \\lim\_{h \\to 0} \\frac{f(a\_1, ..., a\_i+h, ..., a\_n) - f(a\_1, ..., a\_i, ..., a\_n)}{h} \\). It is derived by applying the standard single-variable derivative definition with respect to \\(x\_i\\), treating all other \\(x\_j\\) (for \\(j \\neq i\\)) as fixed parameters.

## Directional Derivative

The directional derivative generalizes the partial derivative, measuring the rate of change of a function \\(f: \\mathbb{R}^n \\to \\mathbb{R}\\) at a point \\(\\mathbf{a}\\) along an arbitrary direction specified by a unit vector \\(\\mathbf{u}\\). It is defined as \\( D\_{\\mathbf{u}}f(\\mathbf{a}) = \\lim\_{h \\to 0} \\frac{f(\\mathbf{a} + h\\mathbf{u}) - f(\\mathbf{a})}{h} \\). If \\(f\\) is differentiable at \\(\\mathbf{a}\\), this can be computed using the gradient \\(\\nabla f = (\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x\_1}, ..., \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x\_n})\\) via the dot product: \\( D\_{\\mathbf{u}}f(\\mathbf{a}) = \\nabla f(\\mathbf{a}) \\cdot \\mathbf{u} \\). The definition applies the limit concept along the line \\(\\mathbf{a} + t\\mathbf{u}\\), while the gradient formula derives from the chain rule applied to \\(g(t) = f(\\mathbf{a} + t\\mathbf{u})\\).

## Covariant Derivative

The covariant derivative, \\(\\nabla\_X T\\), generalizes the directional derivative to tensor fields \\(T\\) on curved spaces (manifolds) equipped with a connection \\(\\nabla\\). It measures the change of \\(T\\) along a vector field \\(X\\), accounting for the variation of the basis vectors or coordinate system. In local coordinates \\(x^i\\) with Christoffel symbols \\(\\Gamma^k\_{ij}\\), the covariant derivative of a vector field \\(V = V^k \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^k}\\) along \\(X = X^j \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^j}\\) has components \\( (\\nabla\_X V)^k = X^j (\\partial\_j V^k + \\Gamma^k\_{ij} V^i) \\), often written in component form as \\( \\nabla\_j V^k = \\partial\_j V^k + \\Gamma^k\_{ij} V^i \\). It is derived axiomatically or by demanding it measure the intrinsic change of the tensor's components plus the change induced by the varying basis, yielding a tensor of the same type.

## Lie Derivative

The Lie derivative, \\( \\mathcal{L}\_X T \\), measures the rate of change of a tensor field \\(T\\) as it is "dragged" along the flow \\(\\phi\_t\\) generated by a vector field \\(X\\). It is defined as \\( \\mathcal{L}\_X T = \\lim\_{t \\to 0} \\frac{\\phi\_{-t}^\* T - T}{t} \\), where \\(\\phi\_{-t}^\* T\\) denotes the pullback of \\(T\\) along the flow. Unlike the covariant derivative, it doesn't require a metric or connection. For a scalar function \\(f\\), it reduces to the directional derivative \\(\\mathcal{L}\_X f = X(f)\\). For a vector field \\(Y\\), it equals the Lie bracket \\(\\mathcal{L}\_X Y = \[X, Y\] = XY - YX\\). Its derivation involves comparing the tensor at a point \\(p\\) with the tensor at \\(\\phi\_t(p)\\) appropriately transported back to \\(p\\).

## Exterior Derivative

The exterior derivative \\(d\\) is an operation mapping differential \\(k\\)-forms \\(\\omega\\) to \\((k+1)\\)-forms \\(d\\omega\\) on a manifold. For a 0-form (function) \\(f\\), \\(df = \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x^i} dx^i\\). For a \\(k\\)-form \\(\\omega = \\sum\_{I} a\_I dx^I\\), \\(d\\omega = \\sum\_{I} da\_I \\wedge dx^I\\). It uniquely satisfies properties like linearity, the graded Leibniz rule, \\(d(d\\omega) = 0\\) (\\(d^2=0\\)), and consistency with the gradient. It provides a coordinate-independent generalization of grad, curl, and div, and is fundamental to the generalized Stokes' theorem: \\( \\int\_M d\\omega = \\int\_{\\partial M} \\omega \\). Its coordinate formula can be derived from these axioms.

## Material Derivative

The material derivative (or substantial derivative, total derivative), denoted \\(\\frac{D\\phi}{Dt}\\), measures the total rate of change of a field \\(\\phi(\\mathbf{x}, t)\\) (like temperature or density) experienced by a particle moving with a velocity field \\(\\mathbf{u}(\\mathbf{x}, t)\\). Its formula is \\( \\frac{D\\phi}{Dt} = \\frac{\\partial \\phi}{\\partial t} + (\\mathbf{u} \\cdot \\nabla) \\phi \\). It combines the local rate of change at a fixed point (\\(\\partial \\phi / \\partial t\\)) with the convective rate of change due to the particle's movement into regions with different \\(\\phi\\) values (\\(\\mathbf{u} \\cdot \\nabla \\phi\\)). It is derived by applying the multivariable chain rule to \\(\\phi(\\mathbf{x}(t), t)\\) where \\(\\frac{d\\mathbf{x}}{dt} = \\mathbf{u}\\).

## Weak Derivative

The weak derivative extends differentiation to functions (like those in Sobolev spaces) which may not be smooth enough for classical differentiation. A function \\(v \\in L^1\_{loc}(\\Omega)\\) is the \\(\\alpha\\)-th weak derivative of \\(u \\in L^1\_{loc}(\\Omega)\\) (denoted \\(D^\\alpha u = v\\)) if \\( \\int\_{\\Omega} u(x) (-1)^{\|\\alpha\|} D^\\alpha \\phi(x) dx = \\int\_{\\Omega} v(x) \\phi(x) dx \\) holds for all smooth test functions \\(\\phi\\) with compact support in \\(\\Omega\\). This definition is motivated by the integration by parts formula, effectively transferring the derivative operation from the potentially non-smooth function \\(u\\) onto the infinitely differentiable test function \\(\\phi\\).

## Fréchet Derivative

The Fréchet derivative generalizes the concept of the derivative to functions \\(f: U \\to W\\) between Banach spaces \\(V\\) and \\(W\\) (\\(U \\subseteq V\\) open). It is a bounded linear operator \\(A: V \\to W\\), denoted \\(Df(x)\\), that provides the best linear approximation of \\(f\\) near \\(x\\). This means \\( \\lim\_{\|h\|\_V \\to 0} \\frac{\|f(x+h) - f(x) - A(h)\|\_W}{\|h\|\_V} = 0 \\), or equivalently, \\(f(x+h) = f(x) + A(h) + o(\|h\|\_V)\\). The definition formalizes the idea \\(f(x+h) \\approx f(x) + f'(x)h\\) where \\(f'(x)h\\) is replaced by the action of the linear map \\(A\\) on the displacement \\(h\\). If it exists, it's unique.

## Gâteaux Derivative

The Gâteaux derivative is another generalization of the derivative for functions \\(f: U \\to W\\) between topological vector spaces, focusing on directional rates of change. The Gâteaux derivative of \\(f\\) at \\(x \\in U\\) in the direction \\(v \\in V\\) is \\( Df(x; v) = \\lim\_{t \\to 0} \\frac{f(x+tv) - f(x)}{t} \\), provided the limit exists (where \\(t\\) is a scalar). It directly generalizes the concept of the directional derivative in \\(\\mathbb{R}^n\\). It is a weaker notion than the Fréchet derivative; Fréchet differentiability implies Gâteaux differentiability along all directions, but the converse is not always true.

## Variational Derivative (Functional Derivative)

The variational derivative, \\(\\frac{\\delta F}{\\delta f(x)}\\), measures how a functional \\(F\[f\]\\) (which maps functions to scalars) changes in response to an infinitesimal, localized variation \\(\\phi(x)\\) in its input function \\(f\\) at point \\(x\\). It is defined implicitly via the first variation: \\( \\delta F = \\int \\frac{\\delta F}{\\delta f(x)} \\phi(x) dx \\), where \\(\\delta F\\) is the linear part (in \\(\\phi\\)) of \\(F\[f + \\epsilon \\phi\] - F\[f\]\\) as \\(\\epsilon \\to 0\\). For functionals defined by an integral of a Lagrangian \\(L(x, f, f', ...)\\), it is often computed using the Euler-Lagrange expression: \\( \\frac{\\delta F}{\\delta f(x)} = \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial f} - \\frac{d}{dx} \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial f'} + \\dots \\). It serves as the functional analogue of the gradient.

## Fractional Derivative

Fractional derivatives generalize the concept of differentiation to non-integer orders \\(\\alpha\\). There isn't a single universal definition, but common forms include the Riemann-Liouville derivative \\( \_a D\_t^\\alpha f(t) = \\frac{1}{\\Gamma(n-\\alpha)} \\frac{d^n}{dt^n} \\int\_a^t (t-\\tau)^{n-\\alpha-1} f(\\tau) d\\tau \\) and the Caputo derivative \\( ^C\_a D\_t^\\alpha f(t) = \\frac{1}{\\Gamma(n-\\alpha)} \\int\_a^t (t-\\tau)^{n-\\alpha-1} f^{(n)}(\\tau) d\\tau \\), where \\(n = \\lceil \\alpha \\rceil\\). These operators extend differentiation and integration to arbitrary real or complex orders. They are typically non-local (depending on the function's history) and find use in modeling phenomena with memory effects or fractal characteristics. Their derivation often involves generalizing properties of integer-order calculus, such as Cauchy's formula for repeated integration or Fourier transform properties.

## Radon-Nikodym Derivative

The Radon-Nikodym derivative \\(f = \\frac{d\\nu}{d\\mu}\\) relates two \\(\\sigma\\)-finite measures \\(\\mu\\) and \\(\\nu\\) on a measurable space \\((X, \\Sigma)\\). Provided that \\(\\nu\\) is absolutely continuous with respect to \\(\\mu\\) (\\(\\nu \\ll \\mu\\), meaning \\(\\mu(A)=0 \\implies \\nu(A)=0\\)), the Radon-Nikodym theorem guarantees the existence of a non-negative measurable function \\(f\\) such that \\( \\nu(A) = \\int\_A f d\\mu \\) for all measurable sets \\(A\\). This function \\(f\\) acts as the density or rate of change of \\(\\nu\\) relative to \\(\\mu\\). If \\(\\mu\\) is Lebesgue measure, it generalizes concepts like probability density functions. Its existence is a deep result from measure theory, not derived from a simple formula but proven using functional analysis techniques.

## Stochastic Derivative

The term "stochastic derivative" often refers to the Malliavin derivative, used in Malliavin calculus for functionals of stochastic processes like Brownian motion \\({W\_t}\\). The Malliavin derivative \\(D\_t F\\) of a random variable \\(F\\) measures its sensitivity to infinitesimal changes in the path of the driving noise at time \\(t\\). For a simple functional \\(F = f(W\_{t\_1}, ..., W\_{t\_n})\\), \\( D\_t F = \\sum\_{i=1}^n \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x\_i}(W\_{t\_1}, ..., W\_{t\_n}) \\mathbf{1}\_{\[0, t\_i\]}(t) \\). It is formally defined via an integration-by-parts formula on Wiener space, making the derivative operator \\(D\\) the adjoint of the Skorokhod stochastic integral \\(\\delta\\). It plays a key role in stochastic analysis and quantitative finance.
