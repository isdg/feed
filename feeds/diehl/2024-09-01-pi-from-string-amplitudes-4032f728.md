# Pi from String Amplitudes

From the [paper by Arnab Priya Saha and Aninda Sinha](https://journals.aps.org/prl/pdf/10.1103/PhysRevLett.132.221601). A new series for \\(\\pi\\) and its convergence.

$$

\\pi = 4 + \\sum\_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{n!} \\left( \\frac{1}{n + \\lambda} - \\frac{4}{2n + 1} \\right) \\left( \\frac{(2n + 1)^2}{4(n + \\lambda)} - n \\right)\_{n-1}

$$

Where \\((a)\_{n-1}\\) is the Pochhammer symbol.

$$

(a)\_{n-1} = \\frac{\\Gamma(a + n - 1)}{\\Gamma(a)}

$$

\\(\\lambda\\) is a free parameter for optimizing convergence. As \\(\\lambda\\) approaches infinity, the series reduces to the classic Madhava series. With \\(\\lambda\\) between 10 and 100, the series takes 30 terms to converge to ten decimal places. Which is far more efficient than the classic [Madhava series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madhava_series), which takes 5 billion terms to converge to ten decimal places.

This can be implemented in Python as follows:

```python
import mpmath as mp

def mp_calculate_pi(lambda_val, iters):
    mp.dps = 100
    pi = mp.mpf(4)
    n = 1
    prev_pi = 0
    factorial = mp.mpf(n)

    for i in range(iters):
        term1 = 1.0 / factorial
        term2 = 1.0 / (n + lambda_val) - 4 / (2 * n + 1)
        term3 = ((2 * n + 1) ** 2) / (4 * (n + lambda_val)) - n

        pochhammer = 1
        for i in range(n - 1):
            pochhammer *= term3 + i

        prev_pi = pi
        pi += term1 * term2 * pochhammer

        # print to 30 decimal places using mpmath
        approx = mp.nstr(pi, 100)

        # Compare to mp.pi to calcualte the delta
        delta = abs(pi - mp.pi)

        # numbers of digits that pi approximate is correct to
        accuracy = round(abs(mp.log(abs(pi - mp.pi), 10)))

        # Print a line with the current iteration, pi, delta
        print(f'{n} {approx} {delta} {accuracy}')

        n += 1
        factorial = factorial * n

    return pi, n - 1

lambda_val = 42
pi, n = mp_calculate_pi(lambda_val, 30)

```
